# Laravel Developer Test Task - Refactored Solution

## Overview
Refactored Laravel application focusing on code quality, bug fixes, security enhancements, and maintainability.

## Changes and Improvements

### 1. Code Refactoring
- **Blade Layout**: Created a common layout (`layout.blade.php`) for consistency.
- **Separate Views**: Split views into `add_product`, `edit_product`, and `product_list`.
- **Method Extraction**: Moved logic to `ProductService` to keep controllers clean.  
  - **Service Layer Pattern**: Implemented the service layer for product CRUD operations in the admin panel, following SOLID principles and ensuring separation of concerns.

### 2. Bug Fixing
- Fixed image upload and storage issues.
- Ensured proper validation for product fields (name, description, price, image).

### 3. Security Improvements
- Added Laravel authentication for admin login/logout.
- Used FormRequest validation (`StoreProductRequest`, `UpdateProductRequest`) to prevent invalid data submission.
  - **Form Requests**: Custom form requests were created for product creation and updating to enforce clean and reusable validation logic.
- Sanitized user inputs to prevent SQL injection.


### 4. Optimization
- Created `ProductService` to handle product business logic, CRUD operations, and image uploads.
- Improved error handling with clear messages for validation and actions.
- Optimized external API calls with fallback for failed requests.

### 5. Code Organization & Best Practices
- Organized controller methods for better CRUD management in `AdminProductController`.
- Followed **PSR-12** coding standards for readability and consistency.
- **Form Requests**: Created `StoreProductRequest` and `UpdateProductRequest` classes for clean validation and error handling.
- Added detailed comments to functions for better code documentation and maintainability.

### 6. Visual and Layout Adjustments
- Centralized layout with dynamic content injection via `@yield` and `@section`.
- Created a central CSS file for consistent styling across admin pages.

### 7. Maintained Existing Functionality
- Preserved all CRUD functionality and visual appearance.
